            </div>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>Jimmy Donaldson was born May 7, 1998. 
            Known more commonly known by his online alias MrBeast, Jimmy is an American YouTuber notable for his expensive stunts and donations to various charities. 
            He has been credited with pioneering a genre of YouTube videos that center on expensive stunts.</p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>Jimmy began posting videos to YouTube in 2011 at age 13 under the username "MrBeast6000". 
            His early content ranged from Let's Plays to "videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers". 
            However, his videos remained in relative obscurity—averaging around a thousand views each—until the release of his 2017 "counting to 100,000" video that earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days. 
            As of November 2020, Jimmy has 46.5 million subscribers on YouTube. 
            His videos typically feature "attention-grabbing stunts". 
            He often makes videos where he donates large amount of money to individuals, with many of these videos being sponsored (although he has donated without a sponsor in the past)</p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>In January 2017, Jimmy published an almost day-long video of himself counting to 100,000. 
            The stunt took him 40 hours, with some parts sped up to "keep it under 24 hours". 
            A subsequent video titled "Counting to 200,000 (Road to a Mil)" was uploaded the next month, although, according to Jimmy, it too, had to be sped up because the full fifty-five hours of counting exceeded YouTube's upload limit. 
            Additionally, Jimmy has tried to break glass using a hundred megaphones, watched paint dry for an hour, attempted to stay underwater for 24 hours (but failed because of health issues), and unsuccessfully attempted to spin a fidget spinner for a day, although the footage is gone. 
            In March 2019, he organized and filmed a real-life battle royale competition in Los Angeles with a prize of $200,000 (2 games were played, making game earnings of $100,000 for each game) in collaboration with Apex Legends. 
            The event and prize pool was sponsored by Apex Legends publisher Electronic Arts.</p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>A typical video involves Jimmy giving away large sums of money, such as giving $100,000 worth of items to homeless shelters in December 2018, donating $32,000 to the Veterans Army Wounded Warrior Program, $70,000 to Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital, and $10,000 to a local animal shelter in Los Angeles. 
            His expensive YouTube videos are mostly funded and sponsored by the coupon company, Honey. 
            During PewDiePie vs T-Series, a competition to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube, Donaldson bought billboards, numerous ads and radio advertisements to help PewDiePie gain more subscribers than T-Series.; 
            at the Super Bowl LIII, he bought multiple seats for him and his team whose shirts spelled out, "Sub 2 PewDiePie".</p>

            <p><span class="tab"></span>On October 25, 2019, Jimmy and former NASA engineer and YouTuber Mark Rober organized a collaborative fundraising challenge event on YouTube called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Trees" target="_blank">#TeamTrees</a>. 
            The goal of this project was to raise $20 million for the Arbor Day Foundation by January 1, 2020 and plant trees "no later than December 2022". 
            In exchange, the organization would plant one tree for each dollar raised. 
            Every donation goes to the Arbor Day Foundation which pledges to plant one tree for every dollar. 
            Notable YouTubers such as Rhett & Link, Marshmello, iJustine, Marques Brownlee, The Slow Mo Guys, Ninja, Simone Giertz, Jacksepticeye, and Smarter Every Day brought attention to this idea. 
            Trees began to be planted in October 2019 in national parks of the United States. 
            By the 24-hour mark of the 67-day project, nearly $4 million had been donated. 
            On December 19 of that year, the $20,000,000 goal was surpassed. 
            As of May 27, 2020, the project reached over 22 million dollars. 
            The project has also received large donations from corporate executives Jack Dorsey, Susan Wojcicki, Elon Musk, and Tobias Lütke.</p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>The idea started on May 24, 2019, when a fan suggested on Reddit that MrBeast should plant 20 million trees to celebrate reaching 20 million subscribers on YouTube. 
            The idea spread across YouTube, Reddit, and Twitter, mostly in the form of memes. 
            The idea may have been related to the 2019 Amazon rainforest wildfires. 
            American YouTuber, engineer, and inventor Mark Rober partnered directly with Jimmy to launch the fundraiser. 
            On October 25, 2019, Jimmy uploaded a YouTube video explaining his plan, which claimed the top spot on YouTube's trending page.</p>

            </div>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>Jimmy partnered with meatpacker Smithfield (one of the companies that supported his $20 million #TeamTrees initiative) to donate one million servings of protein to food banks in his home state of North Carolina. 
            He chronicled the mass donation, which he says took months of planning and $1 million worth of products to pull off, in a 12-minute video he uploaded on March 27, 2020.</p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>To distribute the massive donation, Donaldson and a team of friends filled six of Smithfield’s semi trucks with pallet upon pallet of protein products like hot dogs, sausages, plant-based burgers, and bacon. 
            Then they drove from food bank to food bank, unloading and storing the pallets themselves. 
            At the <a href="https://afoodbank.org/" target="_blank">Food Bank of the Albemarle</a>, an organization that provides food to thousands of across 15 counties, a staffer told Jimmy that protein was especially needed. 
            “Two weeks ago, meat was very scarce,” he said. “It was hard to find.” 
            At the <a href="https://foodbankcenc.org/" target="_blank">Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina</a>, another staffer told Donaldson that in normal times, there are around 600,000 food-insecure people in North Carolina, and around one-third of those are children. 
            “Right now, during the COVID outbreak and the pandemic, we worry about everybody, really,” she said.</p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>Donaldson may have delivered all one million servings of protein, but he isn’t done donating. 
            In his video, he and Smithfield program manager Jonathan reveal they’ve teamed up to fundraise for <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/press-room/feeding-america-establishes-covid-19-response-fund-help-food-banks-during" target="_blank">Feeding America’s COVID-19 Response Fund</a>. 
            For every $1 donated to the fund, Smithfield will provide one more serving of protein to food banks in need. 
            If Donaldson’s 33.2 million subscribers can help raise $1 million total for the fund, Smithfield will double its donation, providing two servings for every $1 contributed.</p>

                <p class="caption">The dealership that Jimmy bought</p>
            </div>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>While Jimmy has opened up stores in the past where all items were priced at just one dollar each, he’s never stepped into the car dealership business – until now.</p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>He uploaded a video on August 29, where he opened up his very own “car dealership”, knocking down the prices of 12 vehicles to amounts like $7, $3, 69 cents, and other low numbers – despite spending over $100,000 on the project. 
            Of course, MrBeast’s generosity did not go unrewarded, leaving customers speechless and even shedding a few tears over the matter, with MrBeast himself getting a bit watery-eyed during the proceedings. 
            Jimmy's “free car dealership” also included a “last to leave” game, with three potential buyers waiting inside the cab to be the last customer standing – but all three ended up getting their own cars anyway, as did MrBeast’s brother, who just started his own YouTube channel on August 28. 
            “This video is very special to me, and we impacted a lot of lives today,” Jimmy said of the project. “We really want to continue doing stuff like this.”</p>
